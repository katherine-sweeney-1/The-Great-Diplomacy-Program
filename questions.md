Commander Class

    Where to create the function/property of adding new units to a commander's unit members?
        => Create new unit => unit class
        => Add unit to commander => commander class property add_member


Need to eventually figure out how to check what territories people own, lost, occupy, etc. make that it's own thing and not part of the commander class


COMPLETED

    => edit the node input so it takes the name and the nested info (nodes dictionary key and value)

    => make own_dots be territory objects

    => make unit_members be unit objects
