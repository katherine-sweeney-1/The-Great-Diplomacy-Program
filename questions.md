Commander Class

    Where to create the function/property of adding new units to a commander's unit members?
        => Create new unit => unit class
        => Add unit to commander => commander class property add_member

Make the own_dots and occ_dots be the territory node objects once the commander class initially works 

Make the unit_members be the unit objects

Need to eventually figure out how to check what territories people own, lost, occupy, etc. make that it's own thing and not part of the commander class


NODES 

go back and make the csv file in form of nested dictionary to easily create single territories
