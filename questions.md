Commander Class

    Where to create the function/property of adding new units to a commander's unit members?
        => Create new unit => unit class
        => Add unit to commander => commander class property add_member


Need to eventually figure out how to check what territories people own, lost, occupy, etc. make that it's own thing and not part of the commander class


Node

    clean up functions_node later

Eventually (do not forget)

    Storing moves in SQL table 

    Graph bullshit

    Check google doc

COMPLETED

    => edit the node input so it takes the name and the nested info (nodes dictionary key and value)

    => make own_dots be territory objects

    => make unit_members be unit objects
